able to listen and take in quite a bit of information by watching in intervals.\n      </span>\n      <p>\n        The recording engaged with topics such as art about the internet, art using the internet, and the one that made me think and got my creative juices going was; what is art.\n        As an artist or rather a digital artist for over 4 years, I have come to realize that as simple as the question \"What is art\" sounds, it is harder to answer than many realize.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We live in a time where things are forever changing, and everyone is running amok to try to stay up-to-date with the changes and be relevant. I too am learning about new art forms each passing day just like I have with web/net art. After going through the readings trying to find a definition of what net art is, I think I understood the definition in the reading about \"The work of Art in the age of the internet.\" It referenced \"The work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction\" and defines net art as reproductions becoming replacements of the original work, the original work being a mere source of reference, and the new art piece being better in a sense of the detail it has online than in person. This is not to say that net art isn’t unique or original.\n        I personally think traditional art forms are still profound and can never truly be replaced; however, I find this net art form interesting because of how diverse an art piece can become. I enjoyed engaging with <a href=\"https://anthology.rhizome.org/my-boyfriend-came-back-from-the-war\" className=\"blinks\">‘My boyfriend came back from the war’</a> art piece.\n        I like how the user gets to interact with the piece to hear about the story and how we get to sort of be in control to some extent of how the conversation goes.\n      </p>\n      <img src=\"./Images/Screenshot 2023-04-22 at 01.06.18.png\" className=\"Bimages\" alt=\"Web image\" />\n      <p>\n        It has been an interesting week with a lot of content to take in.

While there are many different forms of internet art, net-art is unique because it is created specifically for online platforms and often can be confusing and blurs the line between art and technology. \n   For this paper I will be analyzing and discussing net-art I found interesting which is similar to the net-art I was aiming for my assignment 1.\n   Through my analysis I hope to demonstrate the potential of net-art as a platform for artistic expression and experimentation.</p>\n   <br/>\n  <p>\n  The way we view art and produce art has changed over the years from works being reproductions of traditional art to the reproductions being reproduced and becoming new works of art. \n  (Carrier, 2020) phrases the concept of internet art well and says the unique artifact no longer matter but the reproductions that are consumed the most and more viewings. \n  The original work serves as a source and the reproduction and in this case the net-art is a genuine replacement of the object (Carrier, 2020). \n  With the web being a fast-changing space artists and many others such as businesses have had to be flexible in adapting to changes to avoid being in a situation that Flash users were in when it shut down. Companies like SARS were affected and to adapt they decided to create their own web-browser (Cimpanu, 2021). \n  Net-art has brought up a number of dilemmas and challenged the concept of authorship and authenticity making Walter Benjamins predictions in ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction’ a reality (Magazine, n.d.).</p>\n  <p>\n  Before getting into the analysis of my chosen net-art I will speak on the net-art I made briefly because my chosen net-art for analysis was chosen because it is similar to the work I did/was hoping to achieve. \n  For my net-art I wanted to make a website that functions as internet art itself. Essentially, I wanted to create a website that was an interactive coloring book. The user would interact with the website, and it would change color as they go and have an option for them to add their own colors to backgrounds and different objects. \n  The website was to include hover effect interactions that reveal images in the background, animations and other interactive elements to achieve what I wanted. When gathering ideas for my net-art I had to think of the conventions that make up net-art and I will expand on these as I analyze the chosen artwork. \n  Conventions is a term that has many definitions and contexts but I have come to understand them as shared practices and situations that occur frequently under given contexts in different communities and spaces(Mailloux, 1983). At the end of it all I did not manage to fully achieve the above for my net-art so I made a page with a paint canvas where the user could create their own artworks. \n  For the website I have chosen to analyze I could not find the exact artwork/website but I found an alternative site that had the effects and interactivity that I wanted for my net-art. </p>\n  <br/>\n  <p>\n  For this paper I will be analyzing a website called Delve, found here: <a href='https://www.delvearchitects.com/.'></a>\nThis is an architecture company website which has incorporated interesting designs to the site and in my eyes, I view as net-art and collects of this company’s works of art. I consider this website as net art because it is created and distributed on the internet, it is also interactive and participatory, and these two conventions often make up net-art. \nThe homepage is interactive and allows the user to choose how they want to navigate the site. Clicking on one of the color blocks will reveal an image in the background using a hover effect and shows a category, so users can view the companies projects, learn more about their practice, read their stories, or contact them with enquiries. It engages with digital culture with its unique features and possibilities of the internet and visually invites views to engage with the site. \nThe site is user-friendly and makes use of a light color palette which elevates the website and makes it welcoming to users. With the aim of wanting to bring a light-hearted and personable approach to architectural design they achieved this with their use of light colors that bring a feel of vibrance and their understanding of their user. \nThe person going on this site would be in need of architects that would help them on their projects therefore the site offers four sections such as the projects that they have worked on in the past giving the user a glance of what they can expect when working with them. \nThe user-interface of this site was my reason for choosing it as a site to analyze.</p> \n<br/>\n<p>\nBesides this site being a business portfolio, as net-art it did very well with its UI design as it is critical for a good user experience and can have serious impacts on a business and its success because the principles are put in place to make life easier for the user (Pin, 2022). \nThe site has made use of different colors and color change effects that I wanted to make use of in my site. The layout is simple yet meaningful and engaging making the user feel free and at ease as they navigate the website. They made use of minimal actions and though the pages are lively with color the primary focus on each page is still evident. \nThe simple layout makes it predictable but as we know in UI design being predictable is the way to go because it means that the site is easy to understand, and everything is straight to the point. \n</p>\n<br/>\n<p>\nThe use of interaction elements such as the hover and mouse effect that reveals color or images provides the user with useful feedback as they know where they are and what actions can be taken on the particular section. \nI will make reference to this sites home page yet again because it was the main section that drew my attention. The homepage has a square layout with light different colors on each block and the name of the site. When the user hovers over one block it will show you an image related to that particular section and its name. \nThe mouse changes and as a user you know that if you click on there it directs you to that section. This function has enabled them to avoid using the traditional rectangular navigation bar and this gives more space for content. There is a drop-down menu that functions as a nav bar with all the different sections. \nThis has been done before by many websites but when I looked at this one I got a new perspective that has helped me with my own net-art website I am working on as I want to give the user as much space as possible. \n</p>\n<br/>\n<p>\nThis site as a net-art medium is networked, with various users accessing and interacting with the website simultaneously. This networked aspect of the site creates a sense of community and collaboration among viewers and artists. \nThe architects are able to display their work on this website and these projects can be considered works of art. “Art on the net is mostly nothing more than the documentation of art which is not created on the net, but rather outside it and, in terms of content, does not establish any relationship to the net. Net Art functions only on the net and picks out the net or the “net myth” as a theme”.-Vuk Ćosić (Magazine, n.d.). \nJust like this the Delve site documents projects and stories as works of art and this also goes to show how flexible net-art it as it is not strict to a certain aesthetic like other art forms. The use of the internet as a medium of this work enables this brand/company to be recognised worldwide which expands this brand and gives it an online presence. \n</p>\n<br/>\n<p>\nTo conclude my analysis, net-art represents a significant and progressively evolving form of contemporary art that challenges traditional notions of art and exhibition, and authorship and authenticity.\n Through its various and websites for the sake of this paper, artists being the developers of the website are able to experiment with new forms of expression and engage with audiences in unique and interactive ways. \n Despite the challenges that come with creating and showcasing digital art, net-art has been able to reach a wide audience and has provided a platform for underrepresented voices where your work speaks for you and brings in business for example.\n As we continue to explore the possibilities of digital art as digital art students, it is important to recognize and support the innovative work being done and have a better understanding of net-art.\n</p>\n<br/>\n<p className='reflection'>References</p>\n<p>\nCarrier, D., 2020.
