        Having sat down after some time of not being at school and watched the recorded lecture I realised I have such a short attention span, however, that isn’t the point.
        I was able to listen and take in quite a bit of information by watching in intervals.

        The recording engaged with topics such as art about the internet, art using the internet, and the one that made me think and got my creative juices going was; what is art.
        As an artist or rather a digital artist for over 4 years, I have come to realize that as simple as the question "What is art" sounds, it is harder to answer than many realize.

        We live in a time where things are forever changing, and everyone is running amok to try to stay up-to-date with the changes and be relevant. I too am learning about new art forms each passing day just like I have with web/net art. After going through the readings trying to find a definition of what net art is, I think I understood the definition in the reading about "The work of Art in the age of the internet." It referenced "The work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction" and defines net art as reproductions becoming replacements of the original work, the original work being a mere source of reference, and the new art piece being better in a sense of the detail it has online than in person. This is not to say that net art isn’t unique or original.
        I personally think traditional art forms are still profound and can never truly be replaced; however, I find this net art form interesting because of how diverse an art piece can become. I enjoyed engaging with <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/my-boyfriend-came-back-from-the-war" className="blinks">‘My boyfriend came back from the war’</a> art piece.
        I like how the user gets to interact with the piece to hear about the story and how we get to sort of be in control to some extent of how the conversation goes.

        It has been an interesting week with a lot of content to take in. I have not fully figured out how I want to do my website, but the resources provided to us are very helpful in getting ideas and seeing what I would like to make.
        I am also still unsure of how these dev blogs are meant to be structured; however, I am looking forward to the feedback and writing more critical pieces.
